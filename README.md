# TF2 - Not Working dueto ... I don't know why
üß© Plugin for WindowsGSM to run a dedicated server for Black Mesa

## PLEASE ‚≠êSTAR‚≠ê THE REPO IF YOU LIKE IT! THANKS!

### IMPORTANT POINTS, READ FIRST:
- You need to do **Portforwarding**, if you want people outside of your house to be able to connect (look down for it)
- If you want your Server to be Listed: (default is LAN/IP-Connect ONLY!)
  - Link the Server to your Account: Edit Config => **Server GSLT** (https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers App ID 232250)
  - **install the SteamClient( START IT ONCE**, no login, no autostart, just install and start it once)
  - go to the Server.cfg (WindowsGSM Click on **Browse => Server Files**, then go **\tf2\cfg** and open **server.cfg** with Editor)
    - Excange "sv_lan" from 1 to 0
- The Server can not be **connected from the same Machine**. You will need to create the server within Black Mesa game (Multiplayer => create) if one Machine has to act as Server AND Client.

### Port Forwarding (YOU NEED THIS, TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT FROM THE INTERNET(only for servers/pcs at home, Hosted Servers work different there, make sure you have a full IPv4 and if your provider needs explicit portforwarding):
- If You don't know How: Google: YourRouterBrand + Portforwarding
- 27015 UDP - **Default Game Port**(look in the 7th column in WindowsGSM), 
  - this one is needed to be forwarded in your Router!
- 27015 TCP - **QueryPort** default, in theory the QueryPort should not be needed as PortForward

### Connecting to a LAN Server:
- Go to Opptions
- Enable Developer Mode
- Go To Keyboard Bindings and set the Key for the Console
- go Back
- Press that key and enter
  - connect IP_OF_THE_SERVER:GamePort (if port is 27015 you can leave it out)
  - if your in the same network use the local IP of that server, else use you onlineIP
